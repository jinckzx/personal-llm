    "text": "### Combined Best Answer:\n\nTo solve the Two Sum problem, we can use a hash table (or dictionary) to keep track of the indices of the numbers we have encountered so far. Here\u2019s a step-by-step method to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize a hash table**: This will store each number as the key and its index as the value.\n\n2. **Iterate through the array**: For each number in the array, calculate its complement with respect to the target (i.e., `complement = target - nums[i]`).\n\n3. **Check for the complement**: Look in the hash table to see if this complement already exists. If it does, you have found the two numbers that add up to the target.\n\n4. **Store the index**: If the complement is not found, store the current number and its index in the hash table for future reference.\n\n5. **Return the indices**: Once you find a match, return the indices of both numbers.\n\nHere is a sample implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    num_to_index = {}  # Dictionary to store number and its index\n    \n    for index, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_to_index:\n            return [num_to_index[complement], index]\n        num_to_index[num] = index\n    \n    # Since the problem guarantees one solution, we should not reach here\n    return None\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nresult = two_sum(nums, target)\nprint(result)  # Output: [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] == 9\n```\n\n### Complexity Analysis:\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array only once.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case if all numbers are stored in the hash table.\n\nThis method ensures that you find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### Confidence Score: 0.95\n\n### Brief Analysis of Differences:\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: The response from gpt-4o-mini-0 provides a clear, structured approach to solving the problem, including a step-by-step explanation and a code implementation. In contrast, gpt-3.5-turbo-0 simply asks for the problem statement, which is not relevant to providing a solution.\n\n2. **Feedback and Encouragement**: gpt-3.5-turbo-1 offers positive feedback on the solution provided by gpt-4o-mini-0, which is a good practice in collaborative environments but does not contribute to the solution itself.\n\n3. **Completeness**: The gpt-4o-mini-0 response is complete with an example usage and complexity analysis, while the other responses do not provide any solution or relevant information to the problem.\n\nOverall, the response from gpt-4o-mini-0 is comprehensive and effectively addresses the Two Sum problem, making it the best choice.",

      "response": "To solve the Two Sum problem, you can use a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of the numbers you've seen so far and their corresponding indices. This approach allows you to find the two numbers that sum up to the target in a single pass through the array, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).\n\nHere's how you can implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    num_to_index = {}  # Create a dictionary to hold numbers and their indices\n    \n    for index, num in enumerate(nums):  # Iterate through the list with indices\n        complement = target - num  # Calculate the complement\n        \n        if complement in num_to_index:  # Check if the complement is already in the dictionary\n            return [num_to_index[complement], index]  # Return the indices where the pair is found\n        \n        num_to_index[num] = index  # Store the number and its index in the dictionary\n\n    return []  # Return an empty list if no solution is found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Dictionary Creation**: We create a dictionary `num_to_index` to map numbers to their indices.\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number in the `nums` array using `enumerate()` to get both the value and its index.\n3. **Complement Calculation**: For each number, we compute its complement (i.e., the number needed to reach the target when added to the current number).\n4. **Check for Complement**: If the complement exists in our dictionary, it means we have already seen the required number, and we can return the pair of indices.\n5. **Store Current Number**: If the complement is not found, we store the current number along with its index in the dictionary for future reference.\n\n### Example:\n```python\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nprint(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]\n```\n\nIn this example, the numbers at indices 0 and 1 are 2 and 7, which sum up to the target 9.",
