    "text": "### 1. Combined Best Answer\n\nHere\u2019s a refined version of the leap year code that combines the best elements from all three responses:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)\n\n# Input for the year\nyear = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\nif is_leap_year(year):\n    print(f\"{year} is a leap year!\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n```\n\n### 2. Confidence Score\n\n**Confidence Score: 0.95**\n\n### 3. Brief Analysis of Differences\n\n- **Function Implementation**: \n  - All three responses correctly implement the leap year logic. However, the first response uses a more concise return statement, which is cleaner and easier to read.\n  \n- **Input Handling**: \n  - The first response includes user input for the year, making it more interactive. The other two responses hard-code the year as `2022`, which limits flexibility.\n  \n- **Output Formatting**: \n  - The first response uses a simple print statement, while the last two responses utilize f-strings for output, which is more modern and readable in Python 3.6 and above.\n  \n- **Return Values**: \n  - The first response directly returns the boolean result from the condition, while the other two use an if-else structure to return `True` or `False`. The direct return is more concise and preferred in Python.\n\nOverall, the first response is the most user-friendly and concise, while the other two provide a solid implementation but lack interactivity and modern formatting.",

      "response": "The code you've provided is already a complete and functional implementation for determining if a given year is a leap year in Python. However, if you're looking for a more concise way to express this functionality, here's an alternative version:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)\n\n# Example usage\nyear = 2022\nif is_leap_year(year):\n    print(f\"{year} is a leap year\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year\")\n```\n\nThis version streamlines the function to a single return statement. You can use this function by passing any year as an argument, and it will return `True` if the year is a leap year, or `False` otherwise. The example usage checks the year 2022. You can change `year` to any other year to check its leap year status.",
